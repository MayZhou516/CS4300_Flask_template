Her findings contributed to important changes in scientific thinking about prehistoric life and the history of the Earth.\\nAnning searched for fossils in the area\\'s Blue Lias cliffs, particularly during the winter months when landslides exposed new fossils that had to be collected quickly before they were lost to the sea. She nearly died in 1833 during a landslide that killed her dog, Tray. Her discoveries included the first ichthyosaur skeleton correctly identified; the first two more complete plesiosaur skeletons found; the first pterosaur skeleton located outside Germany; and important fish fossils. Her observations played a key role in the discovery that coprolites, known as bezoar stones at the time, were fossilised faeces. She also discovered that belemnite fossils contained fossilised ink sacs like those of modern cephalopods. When geologist Henry De la Beche painted Duria Antiquior, the first widely circulated pictorial representation of a scene from prehistoric life derived from fossil reconstructions, he based it largely on fossils Anning had found, and sold prints of it for her benefit.\\nAnning did not fully participate in the scientific community of 19th-century Britain, who were mostly Anglican gentlemen. She struggled financially for much of her life. Her family was poor, and her father, a cabinetmaker, died when she was eleven.\\nShe became well known in geological circles in Britain, Europe, and America, and was consulted on issues of anatomy as well as about collecting fossils. Nonetheless, as a woman, she was not eligible to join the Geological Society of London and she did not always receive full credit for her scientific contributions. Indeed, she wrote in a letter: \"The world has used me so unkindly, I fear it has made me suspicious of everyone.\" The only scientific writing of hers published in her lifetime appeared in the Magazine of Natural History in 1839, an extract from a letter that Anning had written to the magazine\\'s editor questioning one of its claims.\\nAfter her death in 1847, her unusual life story attracted increasing interest. An uncredited author in All the Year Round, edited by Charles Dickens, wrote of her in 1865 that \"[t]he carpenter\\'s daughter has won a name for herself, and has deserved to win it.\" It has often been claimed that her story was the inspiration for the 1908 tongue-twister \"She sells seashells on the seallshore\" by Terry Sullivan. In 2010, one hundred and sixty-three years after her death, the Royal Society included Anning in a list of the ten British women who have most influenced the history of science.'}, {u'views': 17, u'name': u'Lilias Armstrong', u'summary': u'Lilias Eveline Armstrong (29 September 1882 \\u2013 9 December 1937) was an English phonetician. She worked at University College London, where she attained the rank of reader. Armstrong is most known for her work on English intonation as well as the phonetics and tone of Somali and Kikuyu. Her book on English intonation, written with Ida C. Ward, was in print for 50 years. Armstrong also provided some of the first detailed descriptions of tone in Somali and Kikuyu.\\nArmstrong grew up in Northern England. She graduated from the University of Leeds, where she studied French and Latin. She taught French in an elementary school in the London suburbs for a while, but then joined the University College Phonetics Department, headed by Daniel Jones. Her most notable works were the 1926 book A Handbook of English Intonation, co-written with Ward, the 1934 paper \"The Phonetic Structure of Somali\", and the book The Phonetic and Tonal Structure of Kikuyu, published posthumously in 1940 after she died of a stroke in 1937 at age 55.\\nShe was the subeditor of the International Phonetic Association\\'s journal Le Ma\\xeetre Phon\\xe9tique for more than a decade, and was praised in her day for her teaching, both during the academic term and in the department\\'s summer vacation courses. Jones wrote in his obituary of her that she was \"one of the finest phoneticians in the world\".'}, {u'views': 41, u'name': u'Ann Bannon', u'summary': u'Ann Weldy (born September 15, 1932), better known by her pen name Ann Bannon, is an American author who, from 1957 to 1962, wrote six lesbian pulp fiction novels known as The Beebo Brinker Chronicles. The books\\' enduring popularity and impact on lesbian identity has earned her the title \"Queen of Lesbian Pulp Fiction\". Bannon was a young housewife trying to address her own issues of sexuality when she was inspired to write her first novel. Her subsequent books featured four characters who reappeared throughout the series, including her eponymous heroine, Beebo Brinker, who came to embody the archetype of a butch lesbian. The majority of her characters mirrored people she knew, but their stories reflected a life she did not feel she was able to live. Despite her traditional upbringing and role in married life, her novels defied conventions for romance stories and depictions of lesbians by addressing complex homosexual relationships.\\nHer books shaped lesbian identity for lesbians and heterosexuals alike, but Bannon was mostly unaware of their impact. She stopped writing in 1962. Later, she earned a doctorate in linguistics and became an academic. She endured a difficult marriage for 27 years and, as she separated from her husband in the 1980s, her books were republished; she was stunned to learn of their influence on society. They were released again between 2001 and 2003 and were adapted as an award-winning Off-Broadway production. They are taught in Women\\'s and LGBT studies courses, and Bannon has received numerous awards for pioneering lesbian and gay literature. She has been described as \"the premier fictional representation of US lesbian life in the fifties and sixties\", and it has been said that her books \"rest on the bookshelf of nearly every even faintly literate Lesbian\".'}, {u'views': 1802, u'name': u'Rachel Carson', u'summary': u'Rachel Louise Carson (May 27, 1907 \\u2013 April 14, 1964) was an American marine biologist, author, and conservationist whose book Silent Spring and other writings are credited with advancing the global environmental movement.\\nCarson began her career as an aquatic biologist in the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, and became a full-time nature writer in the 1950s. Her widely praised 1951 bestseller The Sea Around Us won her a U.S. National Book Award, recognition as a gifted writer, and financial security. Her next book, The Edge of the Sea, and the reissued version of her first book, Under the Sea Wind, were also bestsellers. This sea trilogy explores the whole of ocean life from the shores to the depths.\\nLate in the 1950s, Carson turned her attention to conservation, especially some problems that she believed were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result was the book Silent Spring (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although Silent Spring was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, which led to a nationwide ban on DDT and other pesticides. It also inspired a grassroots environmental movement that led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Carson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Jimmy Carter.'}, {u'views': 38, u'name': u'Ursula Franklin', u'summary': u'Ursula Martius Franklin,  (16 September 1921 \\u2013 22 July 2016), was a German-Canadian metallurgist, research physicist, author, and educator who taught at the University of Toronto for more than 40 years. She was the author of The Real World of Technology, which is based on her 1989 Massey Lectures; The Ursula Franklin Reader: Pacifism as a Map, a collection of her papers, interviews, and talks; and Ursula Franklin Speaks: Thoughts and Afterthoughts, containing 22 of her speeches and five interviews between 1986 and 2012. Franklin was a practising Quaker and actively worked on behalf of pacifist and feminist causes. She wrote and spoke extensively about the futility of war and the connection between peace and social justice. Franklin received numerous honours and awards, including the Governor General\\'s Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case for promoting the equality of girls and women in Canada and the Pearson Medal of Peace for her work in advancing human rights. In 2012, she was inducted into the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame. A Toronto high school, Ursula Franklin Academy, has been named in her honour.\\nFranklin is best known for her writings on the political and social effects of technology. For her, technology was much more than machines, gadgets or electronic transmitters. It was a comprehensive system that includes methods, procedures, organization, \"and most of all, a mindset\". She distinguished between holistic technologies used by craft workers or artisans and prescriptive ones associated with a division of labour in large-scale production. Holistic technologies allow artisans to control their own work from start to finish. Prescriptive technologies organize work as a sequence of steps requiring supervision by bosses or managers. Franklin argued that the dominance of prescriptive technologies in modern society discourages critical thinking and promotes \"a culture of compliance\".\\nFor some, Franklin belongs in the intellectual tradition of Harold Innis and Jacques Ellul who warn about technology\\'s tendency to suppress freedom and endanger civilization. Franklin herself acknowledged her debt to Ellul as well as to several other thinkers including Lewis Mumford, C. B. Macpherson, E. F. Schumacher, and Vandana Shiva. This debt was not without recognizing that this list was largely absent of women. In addition to the Philosophy of technology, she believed that science was \"severely impoverished because women are discouraged from taking part in the exploration of knowledge\".'}, {u'views': 431, u'name': u'Barbara McClintock', u'summary': u\"Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 \\u2013 September 2, 1992) was an American scientist and cytogeneticist who was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927. There she started her career as the leader in the development of maize cytogenetics, the focus of her research for the rest of her life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis\\u2014a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.\\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, McClintock discovered transposition and used it to demonstrate that genes are responsible for turning physical characteristics on and off. She developed theories to explain the suppression and expression of genetic information from one generation of maize plants to the next. Due to skepticism of her research and its implications, she stopped publishing her data in 1953.\\nLater, she made an extensive study of the cytogenetics and ethnobotany of maize races from South America. McClintock's research became well understood in the 1960s and 1970s, as other scientists confirmed the mechanisms of genetic change and genetic regulation that she had demonstrated in her maize research in the 1940s and 1950s. Awards and recognition for her contributions to the field followed, including the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded to her in 1983 for the discovery of genetic transposition; she is the only woman to receive an unshared Nobel Prize in that category.\"}, {u'views': 119, u'name': u'Margaret Murray', u'summary': u'Margaret Alice Murray (13 July 1863 \\u2013 13 November 1963) was an Anglo-Indian Egyptologist, archaeologist, anthropologist, historian, and folklorist. The first woman to be appointed as a lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom, she worked at University College London (UCL) from 1898 to 1935. She served as President of the Folklore Society from 1953 to 1955, and published widely over the course of her career.\\nBorn to a wealthy middle-class English family in Calcutta, British India, Murray divided her youth between India, Britain, and Germany, training as both a nurse and a social worker. Moving to London, in 1894 she began studying Egyptology at UCL, developing a friendship with department head Flinders Petrie, who encouraged her early academic publications and appointed her Junior Professor in 1898. In 1902\\u201303 she took part in Petrie\\'s excavations at Abydos, Egypt, there discovering the Osireion temple and the following season investigated the Saqqara cemetery, both of which established her reputation in Egyptology. Supplementing her UCL wage by giving public classes and lectures at the British Museum and Manchester Museum, it was at the latter in 1908 that she led the unwrapping of Khnum-nakht, one of the mummies recovered from the Tomb of the Two Brothers \\u2013 the first time that a woman had publicly unwrapped a mummy. Recognising that British Egyptomania reflected the existence of a widespread public interest in Ancient Egypt, Murray wrote several books on Egyptology targeted at a general audience.\\nMurray also became closely involved in the first-wave feminist movement, joining the Women\\'s Social and Political Union and devoting much time to improving women\\'s status at UCL. Unable to return to Egypt due to the First World War, she focused her research on the witch-cult hypothesis, the theory that the witch trials of Early Modern Christendom were an attempt to extinguish a surviving pre-Christian, pagan religion devoted to a Horned God. Although later academically discredited, the theory gained widespread attention and proved a significant influence on the emerging new religious movement of Wicca. From 1921 to 1931 Murray undertook excavations of prehistoric sites on Malta and Menorca and developed her interest in folkloristics. Awarded an honorary doctorate in 1927, she was appointed assistant professor in 1928 and retired from UCL in 1935. That year she visited Palestine to aid Petrie\\'s excavation of Tall al-Ajjul and in 1937 she led a small excavation at Petra in Jordan. Taking on the presidency of the Folklore Society in later life, she lectured at such institutions as the University of Cambridge and City Literary Institute, and continued to publish in an independent capacity until her death.\\nMurray\\'s work in Egyptology and archaeology was widely acclaimed and earned her the moniker of \"The Grand Old Woman of Egyptology\", although after her death many of her contributions to the field were overshadowed by those of Petrie. Conversely, Murray\\'s work in folkloristics and the history of witchcraft has been academically discredited and her methods in these areas heavily criticised. The influence of her witch-cult theory in both religion and literature has been examined by various scholars, and she herself has been dubbed the \"Grandmother of Wicca\".'}, {u'views': 9, u'name': u'Elizabeth Alexander (scientist)', u'summary': u\"Frances Elizabeth Somerville Alexander (n\\xe9e Caldwell; 13 December 1908 \\u2013 15 October 1958) was a British geologist, academic, and physicist, whose wartime work with radar and radio led to early developments in radio astronomy and whose post-war work on the geology of Singapore is considered a significant foundation to contemporary research. Alexander earned her PhD from Newnham College, Cambridge, and worked in Radio Direction Finding at Singapore Naval Base from 1938 to 1941. In January 1941, unable to return to Singapore from New Zealand, she became Head of Operations Research in New Zealand's Radio Development Lab, Wellington. In 1945, Alexander correctly interpreted that anomalous radar signals picked up on Norfolk Island were caused by the sun. This interpretation became pioneering work in the field of radio astronomy, making her one of the first women scientists to work in that field, albeit briefly.\"}, {u'views': 45, u'name': u'Jean Bartik', u'summary': u'Jean Jennings Bartik (December 27, 1924 \\u2013 March 23, 2011) was one of the original programmers for the ENIAC computer. She studied mathematics in school then began work at the University of Pennsylvania, first manually calculating ballistics trajectories, then using ENIAC to do so. She and her colleagues developed and codified many of the fundamentals of programming while working on the ENIAC, since it was the first computer of its kind. After her work on ENIAC, Bartik went on to work on BINAC and UNIVAC, and spent time at a variety of technical companies as a writer, manager, engineer and programmer.

A native of Champagne-Ardenne, she studied chemistry in France and the United States, earning two PhDs. From 1984 to 1997, she lived near Paris and worked as a research chemist and a sales manager for Air Liquide. She embraced Ra\\xeblism in 1992; the group was unpopular in France and her conversion led to tensions with those around her. Five years later, she joined Clonaid, a Ra\\xeblian organization that sought to clone a human. After her service as their scientific director was publicized, she lost her position with Air Liquide and focused on cloning full-time.\\nIn late 2000, Clonaid announced that they had received a large donation to fund the cloning of a child, and that Boisselier supervised a team of scientists at a secret laboratory in the United States who would soon produce a human clone. For the next year, the project received media coverage\\u2014and regulatory suspicion\\u2014as Boisselier promised the imminent birth of a human clone. In late 2001, she announced that one had been born and that public evidence would soon be offered. This declaration received significant press coverage in the United States, and Boisselier appeared on many television programs. After a court in Florida launched a child welfare investigation, she stated that the cloned child's parents had withdrawn their offer to provide evidence of the cloning and would have no further public comment. No evidence of the cloning, or subsequent procedures reported by Clonaid, was ever offered, and the announcements were widely perceived to have been a hoax.\\nIn 2003, impressed with her management of Clonaid and public relations skill, Ra\\xebl, the founder of Ra\\xeblism, announced that Boisselier would succeed him as the group's leader upon his death.

Gerty was not a nickname, but rather she was named after an Austrian warship. Growing up at a time when women were marginalized in science and allowed few educational opportunities, she gained admittance to medical school, where she met her future husband Carl Ferdinand Cori; upon their graduation in 1920, they married. Because of deteriorating conditions in Europe, the couple emigrated to the United States in 1922. Gerty Cori continued her early interest in medical research, collaborating in the laboratory with Carl. She published research findings coauthored with her husband, as well as publishing singly. Unlike her husband, she had difficulty securing research positions, and the ones she obtained provided meager pay. Her husband insisted on continuing their collaboration, though he was discouraged from doing so by the institutions that employed him.\\nWith her husband Carl and Argentine physiologist Bernardo Houssay, Gerty Cori received the Nobel Prize in 1947 for the discovery of the mechanism by which glycogen\\u2014a derivative of glucose\\u2014is broken down in muscle tissue into lactic acid and then resynthesized in the body and stored as a source of energy (known as the Cori cycle). They also identified the important catalyzing compound, the Cori ester. In 2004, both Gerty and Carl Cori were designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark in recognition of their work in clarifying carbohydrate metabolism.\\nIn 1957, Gerty Cori died after a ten-year struggle with myelosclerosis. She remained active in the research laboratory until the end. She received recognition for her achievements through multiple awards and honors.

She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win twice, the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different sciences, and was part of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was also the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris, and in 1995 became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panth\\xe9on in Paris.\\nShe was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied at Warsaw's clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her older sister Bronis\\u0142awa to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. She shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie and with physicist Henri Becquerel. She won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\\nHer achievements included the development of the theory of radioactivity (a term that she coined), techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium. Under her direction, the world's first studies into the treatment of neoplasms were conducted using radioactive isotopes. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and in Warsaw, which remain major centres of medical research today.

She was the head of the Neoplatonic school at Alexandria, where she taught philosophy and astronomy. She is the first female mathematician whose life is reasonably well recorded.\\nHypatia was renowned in her own lifetime as a great teacher and a wise counselor. Although no writings directly written by her have survived, it is thought that she may have edited the surviving texts of Euclid\\'s Elements and Ptolemy\\'s Almagest and possibly co-written some of the commentaries attributed to her father, Theon of Alexandria. She also wrote a thirteen-volume commentary on Diophantus\\'s Arithmetica, which may survive in part, having been interpolated into Diophantus\\'s original text, and an eight-volume popularization of Apollonius of Perga\\'s treatise on conic sections, which has not survived. She is known to have constructed astrolabes and hydrometers, but did not invent either of these, which were both in use long before she was born. Although she herself was a pagan, she was tolerant towards Christians and taught many Christian students, including Synesius, the future bishop of Ptolemais. Towards the end of her life, Hypatia advised Orestes, the Roman prefect of Alexandria, who was in the midst of a feud with Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria. Rumors spread accusing her of preventing Orestes from reconciling with Cyril and, in March 415 AD, she was murdered by a mob of Christian monks known as the parabalani under the leadership of a lector named Peter.\\nHypatia\\'s death shocked the empire and transformed her into a \"martyr for philosophy\", leading future Neoplatonists such as Damascius to become increasingly fervent in their opposition to Christianity. During the Middle Ages, Hypatia was co-opted as a symbol of Christian virtue and scholars believe she was part of the basis for the legend of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. During the Age of Enlightenment, she became a symbol of opposition to Catholicism. In the nineteenth century, European literature, especially Charles Kingsley\\'s 1853 novel Hypatia, romanticized her as \"the last of the Hellenes\". In the twentieth century, Hypatia became seen as an icon for women\\'s rights and a precursor to the feminist movement.

As a result of the dissolution of nunneries in connection with the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII, and female exclusion from schools and universities, the formal education of British girls and women was effectively non-existent throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. Women slowly gained admittance to learned societies in the UK starting in the 19th century, with the founding of the Zoological Society of London in 1829 and the Royal Entomological Society in 1833, both of which admitted women Fellows from their inception.\\nThe first recorded question of women being admitted to the Royal Society occurred in 1900, when Marian Farquharson, the first female Fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society, sent a letter to the Council of the Royal Society petitioning that \"duly qualified women should have the advantage of full fellowship\". In its reply, the Council stated that the question of women Fellows \"must depend on the interpretation to be placed upon the Royal Charters under which the Society has been governed for more than three hundred years\". When Hertha Ayrton was nominated for Fellowship in 1902, her candidature was turned down on the basis that as a married woman she had no standing in law. The Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 made it illegal for an incorporated society to refuse admission on the grounds of an individual\\'s sex or marital status. While the Society acknowledged the provision of section 1 of the Act in 1925, in reply to a question originally put to them by the Women\\'s Engineering Society three years prior, it was not until 1943 that another woman was nominated for Fellowship. Kathleen Lonsdale and Marjory Stephenson were duly elected in 1945, after a postal vote amending the Society\\'s statutes to explicitly allow women Fellows.\\nAs of 2014, a total of 133 women have been elected Fellows.

Snyder', u'summary': u'Margaret C. \"Peg\" Snyder (born 1929) is an American social scientist with a special interest in women and economic development, particularly in Africa. She was the founding director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), whose name was changed to UN Women in 2011. She was also a co-founder of Women\\'s World Banking and of the African Training and Research Centre for Women.\\nSnyder was born in Syracuse, New York, in 1929. As a young woman, she attended the College of New Rochelle, receiving a bachelor\\'s degree in 1950, and the Catholic University of America, where she received a master\\'s degree in sociology in 1952. Her M.S. thesis at Catholic University was a study of potential effects of the proposal for an Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In 1953 she became dean of women for Le Moyne College in Syracuse, a position she held for eight years.\\nA sabbatical-year in Africa in 1961 changed the course of her career. Invited by the Kenya African Women\\'s Association to work with African women in Kenya, she initially assisted the \"Kennedy Airlifts\" that brought students to American colleges in preparation for Kenya independence in 1964. Kenya women, led by Margaret Kenyatta, daughter of Jomo who would be the nation\\'s first President, then sought her assistance with planning a Kenya Women\\'s Seminar to consult women from throughout the country about what roles women should play in an independent Kenya. After two national seminars, Tanganyika and Uganda were included in an East African Women\\'s Seminar \\nWhen her sabbatical year was over, Snyder decided to give up her position at Le Moyne in order to stay on in Africa, where, sponsored by the Women\\'s Africa Committee, she would serve as an adviser to Umoja wa Wanawake wa Tanganyika (UWT) and continue her work with various groups in Kenya and Tanganyika. In 1965 she became assistant director for the Programme of Eastern African Studies of Syracuse University\\'s Maxwell School, and was assigned as field director of their Ford Foundation assisted doctoral dissertation research on village settlements in Tanzania, with an opportunity to complete her own dissertation research there. She also worked as a consultant to the State University of New York, and for the American Council on Education.\\nSnyder returned to Tanzania (the new name for the union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar) in 1970 to complete her research while tutoring students. In 1971 she received a Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. That same year she joined the United Nations (UN) staff as regional adviser for the Economic Commission for Africa in a post sponsored by the Swedish International Development Agency aimed to create an Africa- Regional Programme on Advancement of Women. In that position, she was responsible for the first data base of statistics on women to include an entire geographical region, for itinerant training courses for rural development workers from governments and NGOs, seminars on the creation of \"national machineries\" such as women\\'s bureaux and national commissions on women, national bibliographies of writings about women, and other activities. She was a co-founder of ECA\\'s African Training and Research Centre for Women, which was to become a model for similar women\\'s programs worldwide, while she also served as first head of the Commission\\'s Voluntary Agencies Bureau.\\nIn 1978 Snyder accepted a position with the United Nations, New York, to be the first director of the Voluntary Fund for the UN Decade for Women (VFDW), later renamed the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). In that position she expanded the scope of her activities beyond Africa to include Asia, the Pacific, Latin America, and the Caribbean. UNIFEM started innovative and experimental programs aimed at improving women\\'s situation and status throughout the world. Its major fields of concentration were economic and political empowerment. For example, it was the first to provide a large scale grant to the Green Belt Movement of Kenya, whose leader, Professor Wangari Maathai, would receive the Nobel Peace Prize. It financed training of women as labor leaders in Latin America, and silk producers in Asia.\\nOnce programs such as these were evaluated as effective, many were adopted or replicated by major funds including the UNDP and the World Bank. Two types of activities pioneered by UNIFEM for the whole UN system were direct support to national non-governmental organizations rather than solely to governments, and creation of revolving loan funds owned by community groups. Initially administratively located in the Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs. VFDW moved as UNIFEM to autonomous association with the UN Development Program, UNDP, in 1985. It worked in cooperation with organizations such as UNICEF and UNDP in the UN system, non-governmental organizations and national governments of low income countries, and national development investment programs such as USAID, SIDA and Canadian CIDA. Its resources came entirely from voluntary contributions rather than from the assessed contributions of governments to the United Nations.\\nUNIFEM faced two major obstacles during its initial decade under Snyder\\'s leadership. Although units/programs directed to women\\'s advancement were being established at national levels, the UN\\'s institutionalizing the growing world concern for equity and justice for women through VFDW/UNIFEM was not yet fully understood by many senior UN and UNDP staff, who sought to move it away from UN headquarters and/or locate it at administratively low levels. The other major obstacle arose when some politicians successfully sought the withdrawal of the US government\\'s annual contributions to its core resources (but not to those of its middle east project partner, UNICEF). Pressure from the Consultative Committee to the Fund, led by Therese Spens of UK, and from a group of NGOs, led to restoration of the US contribution, but at a lower level.\\nSnyder retired from UNIFEM in 1989. Following her retirement, she continued to serve as senior advisor to the UN and United Nations Development Programme. In 1992-93 she was a visiting fellow at Princeton University\\'s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and traveled worldwide to visit activities sponsored by UNIFEM a decade before, with grants from the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations. She wrote the histories of the African Training and Research Centre for Women at UNECA (with co-author Mary Tadesse) and of UNIFEM. She then received a Fulbright award to allow her to spend the 1994-95 academic year teaching at the newly established Women\\'s Studies Programme for MA candidates at Makerere University in Uganda.\\nIn late 2006, Snyder, her former UNIFEM colleague Dr Thelma Awori, and colleagues laid the foundations for the Sirleaf Market Women\\'s Fund, that honors Africa\\'s first elected woman President and assists Liberia to restore community markets and provide education and financial support to market women after 14 years of civil war. She is also a member of the Board of the Green Belt Movement International that supports Kenya\\'s Green Belt Movement by sponsoring information activities and mobilizes resources for the work in Kenya.

In her earlier work she explored the performativity of health care practices, argued that realities are generated within those practices, and noted that since practices differ, so too do realities. The body, as she expressed it, is multiple: it is more than one but it is also less than many (since the different versions of the body also overlap in health care practices). This is an empirical argument about ontology (which is the branch of philosophy that explores being, existence, or the categories of being.) As a part of this she also developed the notion of 'ontological politics', arguing that since realities or the conditions of possibility vary between practices, this means that they are not given but might be changed.\\nMol has been member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences since 2013.\\nMol has written and worked with a range of scholars including John Law.\\nIn a recent talk, Mol relates the concept of globalization to the interconnections of nature.\"}, {u'views': 4, u'name': u'Annette Laming-Emperaire', u'summary': u'Annette Laming-Emperaire (22 October 1917 \\u2013 May 1977) was a French archeologist.\\nBorn in Petrograd, Annette Laming studied philosophy in Paris until World War II began.

She demonstrated that women's contributions were highly significant but largely erased from record because the cultural focus was on the distribution and exchange of valuables rather than its production. The dissertation was published in 1976 by University of Texas Press under the title: Women of Value, Men of Renown: New Perspectives in Trobriand Exchange. It received intense attention and became a highly influential piece of feminist anthropology. In 1992 she published the book Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving at the University of California Press, in which she built on work by Marcel Mauss and Malinowski to present a theory of value and exchange in which there is a basic distinction between alienable and inalienable forms of wealth. Inalienable wealth is a kind of possession that is inablienably tied to its original possessor and which if given away retains some part of them, such wealth has the power to create lasting social divisions.\\nShe was also founding member and president of the Society for Cultural Anthropology and president of the American Anthropological Association whose Distinguished Service Award she received in 1997.\"}, {u'views': 2, u'name': u'Annie Brisset', u'summary': u'Annie Brisset, a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is a Professor of Translation Studies and Discourse Theory at the School of Translation and Interpretation of the University of Ottawa, Canada.'}, {u'views': 3, u'name': u'Annie Marion MacLean', u'summary': u'Annie Marion MacLean (1869\\u20131934) was a pioneering American sociologist of the women\\'s Chicago School, and is sometimes referred to as the \"mother of contemporary ethnography\".

She received her doctorate in linguistic anthropology from University of Texas at Austin and currently teaches at CIESAS-CDMX. She is the co-founder of Chatino Language Documentation Project.\\nBorn in an indigenous community in Oaxaca, Mexico. Emiliana feels a responsibility both to her home community, that of the Chatino people of Oaxaca, and to her professional community of linguistic anthropology. The geographic focus of her research is Oaxaca. Though her training is predominantly in areas of grammar, sound, and word structure, with an emphasis on the linguistic features of tonal languages, her work draws together many areas of inquiry. It crosses the disciplinary boundaries of linguistic anthropology, cultural anthropology, indigenous studies, linguistics, education, and geography. In addition to her training in linguistic anthropology, she brings her native knowledge of Eastern Chatino, an Otomanguean language of Oaxaca, and a record of community engagement. The last has become an important aspect of her research, informing her purpose to bridge scholarly and community efforts toward documenting and preserving indigenous languages and linguistic practices. she is committed to the inclusion of indigenous communities in her research. In concrete terms, this has meant training speakers of indigenous languages in native language literacy and pedagogy.\\nTone workshops:\\nIn 2012, the first of three summer workshops was held. Each workshop lasted ten days. The three workshops were taught by eight linguists from Mexican and US institutions, including myself and two other University of Massachusetts professors: Anthony C. Woodbury (University of Texas), Francisco Arellanes (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico), Eric Campbell (University of California, Santa Barbara), Christian DiCanio (State University of New York at Buffalo), Mario Ch\\xe1vez Pe\\xf3n (Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Superiores en Antropolog\\xeda Social), Alice C. Harris (University of Massachusetts), and John Kingston (University of Massachusetts).\\nAt the workshop series, we provided Otomanguean speakers with the linguistic tools for analyzing the tonal systems of their languages. Each summer, they had fifty students from many major Otomanguean groups, including Zapotecs, Mazatecs, Mixtecs, Triquis, Chinantecs, Me\\u2019phaas, Matlatzincas, and Chatinos. In the mornings, lectures covered the phonetics and phonology of tone, methods of tone discovery and analysis, and illustrative Otomanguean tone systems, while afternoons involved tutorials for students according to their level, followed by breakout gatherings for each of the language groups. The Chatino student group included speakers from seven Eastern Chatino varieties. The students were young people; most were literacy trainers in a federal program, the Instituto Nacional para la Educaci\\xf3n de los Adultos.\\nThis was the first-ever workshop on tones for speakers of languages of the Otomanguean stock. Many of the students have continued to formally study the tonal systems of their native languages and some are producing pedagogical materials to teach with in local schools.\\nPedagogical Material Workshop:\\nPedagogical material workshop. She organized a three-year (2015-2018) workshop series for native speakers of Mexican indigenous languages. This series began in the summer of 2015 in Oaxaca City, on the topic of writing pedagogical grammars. This workshop was taught by Professor Luiz Amaral from the Hispanic Linguistics Program at the University of Massachusetts, who specializes in applied linguistics and language pedagogy. The making of pedagogical grammars in any language is a fundamental step toward scholarly research on that language. The workshop series therefore aims to promote dialogue between the fields of linguistics, indigenous studies, and anthropology to produce grammatical and cultural information useful for speaker communities and to support the right of every speaker to understand the linguistic structure of their own language.\\nLanguage, landscape, and expressive culture:\\nBy investigating the linguistic structure of Chatino has put put her in a position to study anthropological aspects of Chatino speaking communities. Her current research emphases are indigenous peoples\\u2019 land rights, and the relationship between language and landscape, and connecting both to the documentation and revitalization of endangered languages. This project analyzes the connection between the linguistic and physical landscape of the municipality of San Juan Quiahije. This project also explores indigenous ways of talking about the land by telling the story of why, how, and to what extent elder speakers of Eastern Chatino transmit specialized vocabulary and related lexicons to their communities, which are encountering homogenizing influences. Further, it investigates language ideologies and practices as a way of engaging more general topics, such as the effects of Mexican state-building, local development initiatives, democracy, migration, and globalization on the ways Chatinos describe the land.'}, {u'views': 3, u'name': u'Emilie Demant Hatt', u'summary': u'Emilie Demant Hatt (sometimes Emilie Demant-Hatt, or Emilie Demant; n\\xe9e Emilie Demant Hansen) (21 January 1873 - 4 December 1958) was a Danish artist, writer, and ethnographer.

Her fascination for archeology first started when she moved to Silver City, New Mexico, in 1906 with her husband Cornelius.\\nIn 1919 the Cosgroves bought land in Grant County, New Mexico and began excavating Mimbres Valley ceramics. The Mimbres Valley has pre-Columbian culture dating from 200AD to 1150AD. The Cosgroves reportedly spent their free time exploring the Mimbres Valley with their son, Burton Cosgrove, Jr. In the 1920s the Cosgroves met Alfred Vincent Kidder (1885\\u20131963), at the time curator of North American Archeology at Harvard's Peabody Museum. Kidder was extremely impressed with the Cosgroves' amateur archaeological work on Mimbres culture; the Cosgroves were later hired in 1924 by Harvard University\\u2019s Peabody museum through the help of Kidder. Harriet was among the first women in the field of archeology to be professionally employed. She than began professionally excavating sites for the Harvard Peabody Museum, beginning with an expedition in the Mimbres Valley.\\nThe Cosgroves\\u2019 first professional archaeology endeavor was to excavate the Swarts Ruin, also known as the Swarts Ranch Ruin. The Swarts Ruin was part of the Mimbres Valley, however cultural artifacts of this area of the site suggest that the culture was only active between 1000AD \\u2013 1150AD in that area. The Swarts excavation established the Cosgroves as elite Southwestern Archaeologists as well as solidifying their image as a team unit. The site was photographically documented by Cornelius and Harriet made ink drawings of every bowl excavated, totaling over 700 Swarts Ruin pots. In total, nearly 10,000 artifacts were found and chronologically recorded by season. Extremely thorough notes were also taken by Harriet pertaining to room locations on the site, dimensions of these rooms, and the floor\\u2019s soil type; this was done for all burial sites discovered by the Cosgroves. The finds of the site were published in 1932 as \\u201cThe Swarts Ruin: A Typical Mimbres Site in Southwestern New Mexico\\u201d which detailed the findings from 1924\\u20131927 by season. The excavation was deemed \\u201cprodigious\\u201d and is still used as the primary reference for Mimbres Scholars.\\nA year prior to the Cosgroves\\u2019 work at Stalling island they worked on the Gila River site in New Mexico from 1928\\u20131929. After being hired by William Claflin, Jr. (an archeologist from Belmont, Massachusetts) the Cosgroves began work on the Stallings island Mound in Columbia County, Georgia. The site however was discovered to not be well preserved due to more recent aboriginal activity. A group of artifacts found at the site were termed the \\u201cstallings island culture.\\u201d The development of this idea of the culture allowed artifacts to be more accurately grouped by age, material, and groups of people. Cornelius discovered fiber-tempered pottery at the site as well as tools of late Archaic-type in great numbers. Through the work of the Cosgroves the Stalling Island Mound was found to be a shell heap rather than a major ceremonial construction like it was previously thought to be. Furthermore, the Cosgroves work at Stalling island was the first stratigraphic analysis of midden in Georgia.\\nThe last site the Cosgroves worked on as a team was the Hopi Pueblo of Awatovi in Arizona. Burton Cosgrove died in 1936 during the first year of the project. Harriet returned to the site in 1937 and was placed in charge of the pottery tent on the site. She worked in training students and Indian assistants in the processes of washing, sorting, and cataloging the artifacts.

Sancisi-Weerdenburg (23 May 1944, in Haarlem \\u2013 28 May 2000, in Utrecht), was a Dutch ancient historian, specializing in classical Greek and Achaemenid history.\\nSancisi-Weerdenburg began her studies in ancient history at the University of Leiden, graduating in 1967 to research under the supervision of Professor W. den Boer, a specialist in Greek history. For her doctoral thesis she set herself the task, which turned into a perennial theme, of trying to disentangle the complex realities of the Achaemenid Empire from the distorting web created by Greek literary conventions. To do this, she studied Old Persian, primarily on her own, and Iranian archaeology with Louis Vanden Berghe in Ghent. She received her doctor of letters in history and archaeology from Leiden University in 1980. Having taught first at the University of Groningen 1975\\u201389, she achieved the Professorship in Ancient History at Utrecht in 1990. She was a pioneering scholar of ancient Greek history and Persian history. Her work stressed the importance of returning to the classical authors (including the Greek \\u201cfather of history,\\u201d Herodotus, and the Athenian playwright Aeschylus) with fresh critical awareness of the importance of reading them against the backdrop of subtexts and agendas embedded in their complex perceptions of the ancient Persian historys and their 200-year-long empire founded by Cyrus the Great.\\nIn the historiography of the classical tradition and its modern elaborations, the ancient Achaemenid Persian peoples who fought with the Greeks in the so-called Persian Wars became the quintessential Other. Layers of assumptions of Western cultural primacy made it possible to take at face value the words of the Greeks, even when important cues within those sources, combined with primary evidence from the Persian vantage point, cried out for critical reappraisal. Sancisi-Weerdenburg systematically tackled an array of astutely targeted issues in Western traditions on the Achaemenid Persian empire\\u2014including the notion of Decadence as a defining feature of ancient Persian kingship and the notion of the role of harem intrigue as the defining social maneuverability of women in the empire. The themes that became touchstones of the new historical agenda on the Persian empire spearheaded by Sancisi-Weerdenburg invariably resonated with concerns that invited engagement and energetic debate by a stimulating range of scholars.\\nHeleen W.A.M.

She married a Frenchman, S\\xe9journ\\xe9, and participated in cultural life and the world of the cinema, meeting such figures as Andr\\xe9 Breton and Jean Cocteau. Strongly politicized like many others at the times, she divorced her husband, and left occupied France in exile for Mexico, in 1941. There, she became a naturalized Mexican citizen and married another exile, the Russian novelist and revolutionary known as Victor Serge (Viktor Kibalchich or Kibaltchitch, 1890-1947). Soon after his death, she joined the Mexican Communist Party. Later, she remarried with Arnaldo Orfila, director of the Fondo de Cultura Econ\\xf3mica and founder of Siglo XXI Editores.\\nS\\xe9journ\\xe9's militant spirit can be captured from a passage like the following one:\\n\\n[In] spite of extreme demographic density and the lack of machinery and work animals, the members of Precolumbian societies enjoyed physical health, individual independence, security, some leisure, which implies a distribution of resources and an integration to the collectivity that in our days would seem a utopia. From all of this follows that if we refuse to analyze the invasion that destroyed a civilized world and laid the seed of a system in which hunger, humiliation, and bloody repression constitute the only form of survivorship, contemporary underdevelopment should be a result of congenital incapacity, of the irremediable racial inferiority that justified extermination and vassalage.\\n\\nLater, her focus came to rest more and more on what to her was the embodiment of this Prehispanic 'utopia', Quetzalcoatl.\\nDuring the 1950s, S\\xe9journ\\xe9 worked for Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). She did anthropological fieldwork in Oaxaca, but then changed to the field of archaeology, excavating at the pre-Spanish metropolis of Teotihuacan, which she believed was the legendary Tollan. She published several beautifully illustrated books on the art and architecture of Teotihuacan. Although she was the first to recognize the discontinuity between Teotihuacan and the much later Aztec civilization, her archaeological work has been subject to criticism.\\nTo a wider public she became known through her 1957 publication on the cosmology and religion of the Toltecs and Aztecs, translated into English as Burning Water: Thought and Religion in Ancient Mexico. The book's main focus is the figure of Tollan's priestly king, Quetzalcoatl, and his teachings. Five years later, there was a follow-up in Quetzalcoatls' Universe (El Universo de Quetzalcoatl, 1962). Perhaps influenced by the ideas of Carl Jung, or by the historian of religion, Mircea Eliade, with whom S\\xe9journ\\xe9 maintained a correspondence, these books sketch a rather spiritualized image of king Quetzalcoatl and his legendary reign, referring to 'laws of interior preparation' supposedly left by the Toltec king and to advances 'along the road to spirituality' made possible by these.\\nLaurette S\\xe9journ\\xe9's final years were dedicated to bringing education to the Indian peoples of the south of Mexico. Her work is still valued by specialists.\"}, {u'views': 1, u'name': u'LaVerne Jeanne', u'summary': u'LaVerne Masayesva Jeanne is an anthropologist and linguist at the University of Nevada at Reno, where she is an emerita associate professor.\\nShe received her PhD at MIT, where she studied with linguist Ken Hale.

Sharpe, she spent 10 years developing methodologies to study finger flutings. Their work, building on the internal analysis concepts established by Alexander Marshack, was the first to be able to establish unique identities of cave artists through the study of individual hands and the application of 2D:4D finger studies. Their work on finger flutings was the first to show symbolic behavior by children in the Paleolithic through the creation of tectiforms in Rouffignac. Later work showed the role of women and children in the creation of cave art in Rouffignac. Their application of Zipf's Law from communications theory also gave the first replicable methodology for determining whether or not fluted panels represented purposeful communication or a proto form of writing.

One of her more notable studies was that of the Haya land tenure:\\n\\nWe have examined the two forms of landholding and tenancy in the Haya system of land tenure. Although they co-exist, they have different bases, the one as an aspect of the traditional structure and the other as an aspect of the structure developing at the time of the study. The significance of each derives from the particular characteristics of Haya land which is valuable but limited in quantity. In the traditional structure, the land formed the base or medium through which the institution of clientship was expressed and some land is still held under this form of tenure. In the developing structure, the pressure on the land makes for heterogeneous arrangements, here considered under the rubric of the relatively new form of tenure.\\n\\nReining also pioneered and implicated the Landsat imagery technology in the field of anthropology and other social sciences.

In 1999 she presented her Ph.D. thesis at the Chair of Ethnology of Moscow State University.\\nWhen the First Chechen War broke out in 1994, Bersanova was working on her Ph.D. thesis. The Chechen capital Grozny was being shelled and bombed by the Russian federal army and innocent civilians died in their homes and in the streets. Bersanova understood that she could not stand idly by. First she took part in the protest meetings, and then she began to write articles and books about the war. She realized that the war had resulted in the Chechen people suffering from deep moral trauma. Since then she has been researching for several years on the spiritual values of the present-day Chechens. Her findings argue that the Chechen people have a considerable positive potential even after the inhumane tragedy of war and that they maintain faith in the value of compassion and humanistic traditions.\\nIn 1999 Bersanova presented her research in the lecture held in the Andrei Sakharov Museum in Moscow and in 2004 and 2005, she participated in a series of conferences in the United States, funded through the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, on the issues of war and peace. It was there that she conceived the idea of consolidating the efforts of all the researchers of the Chechen culture in order to help stop the violence. Together with her fellow researchers, Bersanova founded the International Center for Chechen Studies, striving to make the real face of the Chechen people and Chechnya's rich history and spiritual cultural achievements visible to the world.

One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first compiler related tools. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.\\nHopper had attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II, but she was rejected by the military because she was 34 years of age and thus too old to enlist. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began her computing career when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team that was led by Howard H. Aiken. In 1949, she joined the Eckert\\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the development team that designed the UNIVAC I computer in 1944. It was at Eckert\\u2013Mauchly that she began developing the compiler. She believed that computer code could be written in English by using a programming language that was based on English words. The compiler would convert that code into machine code that would be understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper finished her program linker (originally called a compiler), which was written for the A-0 System.\\nIn 1954, Eckert\\u2013Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC. In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the COBOL language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on English words. In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967, the Navy recalled her to active duty. She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the Digital Equipment Corporation, sharing her computing experiences.\\nOwing to her accomplishments and her naval rank, she was sometimes referred to as \"Amazing Grace\". The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 \"Hopper\" supercomputer at NERSC. During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world. A college at Yale University is named in her honor. In 1991, she received the National Medal of Technology.

In 1966 Mark Kac asked whether the shape of a drum could be determined by the sound it makes (whether a Riemannian manifold is determined by the spectrum of its Laplace-Beltrami operator). John Milnor observed that a theorem due to Witt implied the existence of a pair of 16-dimensional tori that have the same spectrum but different shapes. However, the problem in two dimensions remained open until 1992, when Gordon, with coauthors Webb and Wolpert, constructed a pair of regions in the Euclidean plane that have different shapes but identical eigenvalues (see figure on right). In further work, Gordon and Webb produced convex isospectral domains in the hyperbolic plane and in Euclidean space.\\nGordon has written or coauthored over 30 articles on isospectral geometry including work on isospectral closed Riemannian manifolds with a common Riemannian covering. These isospectral Riemannian manifolds have the same local geometry but different topology. They can be found using the Sunada method.

In 1866 Elizaveta married Viktor Litvinov, which, unlike Vladimir Kovalevskii (Sofia Kovalevskaya's husband), would not allow her to travel to Europe to study at the universities there. Thus, Litvinova started to study with Strannoliubskii, who had also privately tutored Kovalevskaya.\\nIn 1872, as soon as her husband died, Litvinova went to Z\\xfcrich and enrolled at a polytechnic institute. In 1873 the Russian czar decreed all Russian women studying in Z\\xfcrich had to return to Russia or face the consequences. Litvinova was one of the few to ignore the decree and she remained to continue her studies, earning her baccalaureate in Z\\xfcrich in 1876 and her doctoral degree in 1878 from the University of Bern.\\nWhen Litvinova returned to Russia, she was denied university appointments because she had defied the 1873 recall. She taught at a women's high school and supplemented her meager income by writing biographies of more famous mathematicians such as Kovalevskaya and Aristotle.
