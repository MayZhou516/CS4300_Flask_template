Born in Greater Manchester, Brodie studied chemical pathology to a doctoral level in Sheffield and was awarded a fellowship sponsored by National Institutes of Health. After 17 years of working in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts on oral contraceptives with Harry Brodie, whom she married, she switched focus to the effects of the oestrogen-producing enzyme, aromatase, on breast cancer.\\nBrodie managed to get an aromatase inhibitor into a limited clinical trial in breast cancer patients in London, which had such a profound effect that it led to Novartis-sponsored trials, the development of formestane, the first aromatase inhibitor, eventually marketed in 1994. Brodie\\'s work has been hailed \"as among the most important contributions to cancer cure.\"'},\n",
